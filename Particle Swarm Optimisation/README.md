# Particle Swarm Optimization

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a population based stochastic optimization technique
inspired by social behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling.

## Python Libraries Used

1. PySwarms: PySwarms is a an extensible research toolkit for particle swarm optimization (PSO) in Python. It is intended for swarm intelligence researchers, practitioners, and students who would like a high-level declarative interface of implementing PSO in their problems.

2. Keras: Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation.

3. Sklearn: Scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.


## Running Of Code

Input datasets are provided to the code in the following lines:

dataset1 = np.loadtxt("train_1.csv", delimiter=",")

dataset2 = np.loadtxt("test_1.csv", delimiter=",")

where dataset1 is the training set and dataset2 is the testing set.
